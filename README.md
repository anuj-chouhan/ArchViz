# Unity 3D Virtual Tour App for Engineers & Architects

**Overview**  
This Unity app is designed to give engineers, architects, and designers a robust and immersive tool for presenting their projects to clients and collaborators. With this app, users can navigate through detailed 3D environments that represent architectural projects, such as homes, buildings, landscapes, interiors, and other structural designs.

The app provides two main navigation modes: First-Person and Drone mode. First-Person view allows users to explore spaces as if they were walking through them, ideal for experiencing layouts and room dimensions. Drone mode gives users a bird’s-eye perspective, enabling free movement through walls and ceilings for an unrestricted view of any area, making it particularly useful for larger or multi-story structures. The control scheme is designed for ease of use on mobile devices, with options for touch-based movement, a joystick, and gyroscope controls for a VR-like experience without a headset.
